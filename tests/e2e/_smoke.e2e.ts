 * Phase-0 smoke for the UI-driven E2E scaffolding. Confirms:
 *   - page objects locate their stable anchors,
 *   - `seedConnection` writes through the IPC bridge,
 *   - the seeded connection round-trips through the renderer's connection list,
 *   - no console errors fire during the boot+seed path.
 *
 * Feature-level happy paths land in cNN/wNN/aNN/xNN/fNN spec files in later phases.
