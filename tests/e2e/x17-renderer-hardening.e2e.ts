/**
 * Renderer hardening, asserted by behaviour rather than by configuration.
 *
 * Every check here reads what the browser actually enforces, never what
 * `main.ts` was asked to set. That distinction is the whole point: a
 * Content-Security-Policy served as a header is delivered by
 * `webRequest.onHeadersReceived`, and whether that fires at all depends on the
 * URL scheme the document was loaded from. Asserting the string we passed to
 * `callback()` would pass identically if the header never reached the document.
 *
 * This runs against the built bundle over `file://` — `run-e2e.sh` launches
 * without `VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL`, so `main.ts` takes the `loadFile` branch,
 * which is the same path a packaged app takes and the stricter of the two
 * policies.
