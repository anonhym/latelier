 * DB-list fetch: the navigator has no root until the Switcher click below, and
 * by then the database is already visible server-side (confirmed by the poll
 * further down), so there is no window for the tree to run ahead of the data.
 *
 * The Switcher click does issue `mongo.connect`, which opens a *new*
 * `MongoClient` over the one `doc.insert` already warmed (`MongoPool.connect()`
 * does not short-circuit an already-connected entry the way `getClient()`
 * does). That reconnect is only safe because of the poll below: the database
 * is confirmed visible server-side before the navigator exists to ask for it.
 *
 * Also polls `listDatabases` until it actually reports the new database
 * before pointing the Data View at the Connection. A successful `doc.insert`
 * is not sufficient — MongoDB creates a database's catalog entry lazily, and
 * a `listDatabases` admin command issued immediately after can still observe
 * a stale snapshot that predates it (reproduced directly: a `listDatabases`
 * call made right after seeding returned `[]`, while the identical call a few
 * seconds later returned `[{name: 'shop', ...}]`). Confirming visibility
 * server-side first, rather than just trusting the write resolved, is what
 * actually closes the race.
