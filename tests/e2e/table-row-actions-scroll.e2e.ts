/**
 * The Table view's per-row actions column can't use native
 * `position: sticky; right: 0` — its nearest non-`visible`-overflow
 * ancestor is react-window's own `List` element (`[role="grid"]`), which
 * never actually scrolls itself (see `TableView.tsx`'s own comment on
 * `data-testid="table-scroll-container"`). The offset that keeps it pinned
 * under horizontal scroll is computed by hand instead, and nothing but this
 * spec exercises it against a real, laid-out browser — jsdom's component
 * tests have no real box model to catch a wrong formula.
