# A03 — Stage accordion + add-stage picker

## Purpose

The center of the aggregation tab: a vertical list of stages where each one expands into a split editor + stage-output preview. Between every stage and above/below the list, an "+Add stage" pill opens a searchable picker that inserts a new stage at the right position.

## Scope

- **In**: Stage row (collapsed + expanded layout), editor (textarea with EJSON validation), stage preview pane driven by A04 §4, per-stage toolbar (toggle, reorder, delete), add-stage pill + picker.
- **Out**: Pipeline-level ops (A02), runner internals (A04), output panel (A05).

## Dependencies

- A02 (model), A04 (stage-preview IPC), F04.

## 1. Stage row — collapsed

Header line, always visible:
```
[⋮⋮] [#] [$match]  field-summary                   [ctr] [ON] [▲][▼][🗑] [▾]
```
- `⋮⋮` drag handle (handed off to outline's drag but also works here).
- `#` index (1-based).
- `$match` colored badge (OP_COLOR). **Editable (T2.1)**: the badge is a
  button, not read-only text. Clicking it opens the same `StageOpPicker`
  used by the add-stage pill (§4), anchored under the badge, so a
  mis-picked operator can be swapped in place without deleting the stage.
  The click stops propagation so it doesn't also toggle the row's
  expand/collapse. Body handling on op-change is deterministic: the
  existing body is preserved unless it's empty or still equals the prior
  op's default body (`DEFAULT_BODIES`), in which case it's replaced with
  the new op's default (see `setOp` in `pipeline.ts`).
- Field-summary: heuristic one-line summary of the body (e.g., `date: …` for a match, `account: …` for a group). Algorithm:
  - Parse EJSON; if fails, show `"(invalid)"` in warn color.
  - If `op === '$match'`: take first key → `field: …`.
  - If `op === '$group'`: show `_id: …, metrics: N`.
  - Else first line of body truncated.
- `ctr` — count after this stage (from the last run). Gray badge. "stale" indicator (⚠) if stage edited since last run.
- `ON/OFF` toggle.
- `▲`/`▼` move; `🗑` delete.
- `▾` expand.

## 2. Stage row — expanded (split view)

```

### Editor
- Monospace textarea. Grows with content, height clamped (min 140, max 500 px; user-resizable via resize handle).
- Inline validation: EJSON parse on blur (or after 400ms idle). Error → red bar under editor with message.
- `Format` button pretty-prints via `EJSON.stringify(parsed, { relaxed: false })` with 2-space indent; if parse fails, no-op + toast.
- `Copy` copies the current body to clipboard.
- `Shift+⌘↵` runs only up to this stage (calls `agg:previewUpToStage`, A04 §4).
- **Autocomplete** (X02 + X03): field-name and MQL-operator
  suggestions at key positions, field-ref suggestions inside `"$…"`
  strings on the value side or in arrays. Wired via
  `useTextareaAutocomplete({ stageOp: stage.op, … })` so operator
  ranking is context-aware — accumulators rank first inside `$group`
  bodies, expression ops inside `$project`/`$set`/`$addFields`, query
  ops everywhere inside `$match`, full catalog inside `$facet` and
  unknown stages. The tab's current `lastRun.rows` supplies
  `recentDocs`. `valueFor` hits are detected but suppressed until
  value sources land.

### Stage preview
- Reads `lastRun.stageSamples[stage.id]` (an array of up to 5 EJSON docs; see A04).
- If no run yet: "Run to see output" placeholder.
- If stage disabled: "Stage is disabled" placeholder.
- "Refresh preview" button calls `agg:previewUpToStage({stageId, limit: 5})` and updates in place.

## 3. Interactions

- Clicking the collapsed header expands/collapses; exactly ONE stage is expanded at a time (accordion). Clicking another stage closes the first.
- `activeStageId` in pipeline state reflects the expanded stage.
- Escape in the editor unfocuses.

## 4. Add-stage pill + `StageOpPicker` (T2.1)

Located before the first stage, between every pair of stages, and after the last stage (matches existing mock).

The picker itself — search input, keyboard nav, operator list, doc side-panel — is a single shared `StageOpPicker` component. It's used from two triggers: the add-stage pill (inserts a new stage) and the stage-row op badge (§1, changes an existing stage's op in place). Both get identical search/keyboard/description behavior for free.

- Click opens a popover anchored below the trigger:
  - Input: search.
  - List of operators (`KNOWN_STAGE_OPS`, 24 entries as of T2.1 — the
    original 16 plus `$facet`, `$bucket`, `$sample`, `$graphLookup`,
    `$unionWith`, `$setWindowFields`, `$geoNear`, `$documents`). Each
    item: colored badge + operator + short description (description
    drawn from the shared `OPERATORS` catalog via `stageOperatorSummary`;
    see X03 §1).
  - Search accepts bare names — typing `sort` matches `$sort`.
  - Keyboard: `↑/↓` to navigate; `Enter` to pick; `Esc` closes.
  - **"Other / custom stage…"** row at the bottom of the list (T2.1):
    reveals a small text input; submitting (`Enter` or the `Add` button)
    picks `$<name>` (normalized to a single leading `$`). `Stage.op` is
    already typed `StageOp | string`, so custom ops need no type change;
    `validatePipeline` already warns (doesn't block) on non-`KNOWN` ops,
    and the row/outline already render an "Unknown op" badge for them —
    that path now also carries user-authored custom ops.
- Picking inserts the stage at the pill's position with a sensible default body (matches existing `defaultBodies` map). The new stage is auto-expanded.

### Default bodies (updated)

```ts
const DEFAULTS: Record<StageOp, string> = {
  '$match':      '{\n  \n}',
  '$group':      '{\n  _id: "$field",\n  count: { $sum: 1 }\n}',
  '$sort':       '{ field: 1 }',
  '$project':    '{\n  field: 1\n}',
  '$addFields':  '{\n  newField: "$existingField"\n}',
  '$set':        '{\n  newField: "$existingField"\n}',
  '$unset':      '"fieldToDrop"',
  '$limit':      '100',
  '$skip':       '0',
  '$count':      '"totalCount"',
  '$lookup':     '{\n  from: "collection",\n  localField: "_id",\n  foreignField: "_id",\n  as: "result"\n}',
  '$unwind':     '"$arrayField"',
  '$replaceRoot':'{ newRoot: "$subdoc" }',
  '$redact':     '"$$KEEP"',
  '$out':        '"outputCollection"',
  '$merge':      '{\n  into: "outputCollection",\n  whenMatched: "merge",\n  whenNotMatched: "insert"\n}',
  // T2.1 — the 8 named common stages added to the curated set:
  '$facet':           '{\n  outputA: [ ]\n}',
  '$bucket':          '{\n  groupBy: "$field",\n  boundaries: [ ],\n  default: "other",\n  output: { }\n}',
  '$sample':          '{ size: 100 }',
  '$graphLookup':     '{\n  from: "collection",\n  startWith: "$field",\n  connectFromField: "field",\n  connectToField: "field",\n  as: "result"\n}',
  '$unionWith':       '{\n  coll: "collection",\n  pipeline: [ ]\n}',
  '$setWindowFields': '{\n  partitionBy: "$field",\n  sortBy: { field: 1 },\n  output: { }\n}',
  '$geoNear':         '{\n  near: { type: "Point", coordinates: [ 0, 0 ] },\n  distanceField: "dist",\n  spherical: true\n}',
  '$documents':       '[ ]',
};
```

Note: like the pre-existing defaults above (unquoted keys, e.g. `$group`'s `_id: "$field"`), these are "sensible" placeholders, not strict-JSON. `validateStageBody`/`isValidEjson` requires strict JSON (`JSON.parse`), so several defaults — old and new — intentionally fail validation until the user edits them; that's expected, not a bug.

## 5. Write-stage guard

Any `$out` or `$merge` stage shows a warning strip across the stage header: "This stage writes to MongoDB. Runs outside Explain will modify data." Disabling the stage hides the warning.

## 6. Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Expanding a stage activates it in the outline; only one stage is expanded at a time.
- [ ] Editing the body and unfocusing validates as EJSON; invalid shows inline error.
- [ ] `Format` pretty-prints valid bodies; silently no-ops on invalid.
- [ ] The add-stage pill picker supports keyboard navigation and search.
- [ ] Inserted stages receive sensible default bodies; id is unique; ordering matches pill position.
- [ ] `$out` / `$merge` stages show a write warning in the header.
- [ ] `Shift+⌘↵` runs a preview up to that stage.
- [ ] **(T2.1)** A stage's operator can be changed in place from the collapsed header, without deleting/re-adding the stage.
- [ ] **(T2.1)** The op picker offers the expanded curated set (24 ops, including the 8 named common stages) plus an "Other / custom stage…" escape hatch for any `$operator` name.
- [ ] **(T2.1)** A stage whose op isn't a recognized operator shows the "Unknown op" badge (row + outline); a curated op does not.
- [ ] **(T2.1)** Changing op to/from `$out`/`$merge` toggles the write-warning strip.
- [ ] **(T2.1)** Changing a stage's op with its body unchanged marks the stage stale (the run/stale signature is keyed on op **and** body — see `stageSig` in `pipeline.ts` — not body alone).
- [ ] **(T2.1)** Body-on-op-change is deterministic: the user's body is preserved unless it was empty or equalled the prior op's default body.

## 7. Test cases

### Component
- **collapsed-render.spec.tsx**: summary heuristic for `$match` / `$group`.
- **expand-single.spec.tsx**: expanding stage 2 collapses stage 1.
- **editor-validate.spec.tsx**: typing invalid EJSON → error bar; valid body clears it.
- **format-click.spec.tsx**: mock valid body → clicking Format calls `EJSON.stringify` indirectly (observe textarea value).
- **stage-accordion.spec.tsx** (`StageOpPicker` / T2.1): open picker → type "mat" → highlights `$match` → enter inserts at correct index with default body. Typing `sort` (no `$`) matches `$sort`. Clicking the stage-row op badge opens the same picker and calls `onChangeOp`; "Other / custom stage…" submits a normalized `$name`; unknown-op badge renders only for non-curated ops.
- **aggregation-tab.spec.tsx** (T2.1): changing a stage's op after a run (body unchanged) marks it stale; changing op to `$out` shows the write-warning strip, changing away hides it.
- **keyboard-run-stage.spec.tsx**: Shift+⌘↵ in editor → `api.agg.previewUpToStage` called with stage id.
- **write-warning.spec.tsx**: adding `$out` renders the warning strip.

### Unit
- **pipeline-ops.spec.ts**: `setOp` body-preservation rules (preserve / swap-to-default on empty / swap-to-default on prior-default, custom op, missing id no-op); `stageSig` differs on op-only and body-only changes; `KNOWN_STAGE_OPS`/`DEFAULT_BODIES` include the 8 named stages.

### Integration
Preview-up-to-stage covered in A04 tests.
