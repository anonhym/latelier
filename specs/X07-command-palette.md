# X07 — Command palette

## Purpose

Give the user one keystroke (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`) to reach every action in the app. Replaces the hardcoded `CmdKStub` in `ConnectionManager.tsx` with a global, extensible palette backed by a renderer-side registry. Two wins:

1. **Discoverability.** Hidden features become self-documenting — searching "reference" surfaces the references editor; searching "save" surfaces the Save dialog. The X06 hints solve "how do I notice this exists in context"; the palette solves "I know it exists, where is it".
2. **Reach.** Power users skip menu-hunting and get to any action with three keystrokes (`⌘K`, type, Enter), regardless of which page or tab they're on.

The palette ships as renderer-only — no IPC. State lives in React context; the catalog is dynamic (commands register themselves when their owning component mounts and unregister on unmount).

## Scope

- **In**: `Command` type, `CommandRegistry` context, `useRegisterCommands(commands)` hook, `<CommandPalette>` component mounted globally in `App.tsx`, `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` global shortcut, Esc to close, ranked search, grouped results, keyboard navigation, recent-commands MRU (session-only), v1 catalog covering Connections / Workspace (collection + aggregation) / global.
- **Out** (deferred):
  - **Persistent MRU** across relaunches (v1 keeps MRU in memory only).
  - **Per-command keybindings** — the palette displays existing shortcuts (e.g., `⌘T`) but does not own them. Rebinding lives in a future `keybindings` spec.
  - **Multi-step / nested commands** ("Open recent query > pick which one") — v1 flattens dynamic sublists into top-level entries (e.g., `connection.switch:<id>` per connection). A "deferred run with parameters" UX waits.
  - **User-defined commands** / scripting / macros.
  - **Telemetry** on command usage.
  - **Internationalization** — copy is English-only and lives at the registration site.
  - **Theming** — palette uses the existing `Theme` tokens; no separate themeable surface.

## Dependencies

- F04 (IPC bridge) — only indirectly. Some commands invoke `api.*` channels but the palette itself does not register handlers.
- W01 (workspace shell) — the active tab + tab list are read from `useWorkspaceTabs`; per-tab commands register from inside the tab subtree.
- C05 (ConnectionManager) — replaces `CmdKStub`; existing `⌘K` listener moves to the global handler.
- X05, X06, X01 — provide actions surfaced in the catalog (configure references, reset hints, toggle theme).

## See also

- **X06 — Contextual feature hints**: hints surface a feature once, in context. The palette surfaces every feature, always. Both should reach the same primitive (e.g., the `references.configure` hint's CTA and the `references.configure` palette command should call the same function). X06 also defines a `palette.discover` hint anchored to the `⌘K` button — it fires the first time a user lands in the app and has not yet opened the palette this session, closing the discoverability loop on the palette itself. The palette records `recordSessionEvent('palette', 'opened')` on every open so the hint self-suppresses after first use.
- The old **"P1 — Cmd-K feature palette"** item: this spec replaced it, and the palette has since shipped (`src/commands/CommandPalette.tsx`).

## 1. Types

```ts
// src/commands/types.ts (renderer-only)

export type CommandGroup =
  | 'general'
  | 'connection'
  | 'workspace'
  | 'query'
  | 'aggregation'
  | 'view'
  | 'references'
  | 'navigation';

export interface PaletteContext {
  /** react-router pathname; one of '/connections', '/connections/:id', '/workspace', etc. */
  pathname: string;
  /** Active connection id, parsed from `/connections/:id`. */
  connectionId: string | null;
}

// The active workspace tab is intentionally NOT carried in `PaletteContext`.
// Tab-scoped commands (`query.run`, `view.mode.*`, `agg.run`, …) register from
// inside the active tab subtree and capture tab state via closures + refs;
// they automatically vanish when the tab unmounts. Adding `activeTab` here
// would create a second source of truth and force every consumer to subscribe
// to the workspace tabs hook.

export interface Command {
  /** Stable, unique. Dotted namespace recommended (`query.run`, `tab.close`). */
  id: string;
  /** Shown in the palette row. <= 60 chars. */
  title: string;
  /** Optional secondary line shown muted under the title. <= 80 chars. */
  subtitle?: string;
  /** Header bucket the command renders under. */
  group: CommandGroup;
  /** Free-text aliases that match the search query in addition to `title`. */
  keywords?: string[];
  /** Optional pre-formatted shortcut hint, e.g. `⌘T`. Display-only. */
  shortcut?: string;
  /**
   * Optional dynamic gate. Defaults to `() => true`. Evaluated each time the
   * palette opens and on every keystroke; must be cheap.
   */
  when?: (ctx: PaletteContext) => boolean;
  /**
   * Side-effecting handler. Receives the palette context. Performing a
   * command always closes the palette; v1 has no "stay open" affordance.
   */
  perform: (ctx: PaletteContext) => void | Promise<void>;
}
```

Commands are not serializable — `perform` is a closure over the registering component's state. This is deliberate: it removes the need for an event-bus indirection and keeps the per-command code where it belongs.

## 2. Architecture

### Singleton registry (in-renderer)

```ts
// src/commands/registry.ts

interface CommandRegistry {
  list(): Command[];                       // all currently registered
  add(commands: Command[]): () => void;    // returns unregister fn
  subscribe(cb: () => void): () => void;   // notifies the palette to re-render
}

export const commandRegistry: CommandRegistry;
```

Implementation is a `Map<id, Command>` plus a tiny pub/sub. Registering an id that already exists overwrites and warns once via `console.warn` (dev-only). This catches typos but doesn't crash if two components race to register.

### `useRegisterCommands(commands)`

```ts
function useRegisterCommands(
  commands: Command[],
  deps: React.DependencyList,
): void;
```

- Calls `commandRegistry.add(commands)` on mount and on `deps` change.
- Returns the unregister fn from the effect cleanup.
- Stable identity: callers MUST list every closed-over value in `deps`. Bad deps → stale `perform` closures (same risk as `useCallback`).

### `<CommandPalette>` component

Mounted once in `src/App.tsx`, inside `<HintsProvider>` so hints can also fire while the palette is closed but suppress while it's open (see §6).

Reads:
- `commandRegistry` (subscribed).
- `PaletteContext` from a sibling `<PaletteContextProvider>` (next item).
- `useTheme` for tokens.
- `useNavigate` for nav-style commands.

State (local):
- `open: boolean`
- `query: string`
- `cursor: number` (selected row index in the filtered list)
- Session MRU `string[]` of recently performed command ids (cap 10).

### `<PaletteContextProvider>`

Tiny context published by `App.tsx` at the same level as the palette. Reads route from `useLocation`, active connection from the URL or `useConnections().selected`, and active tab from `useWorkspaceTabs()` when on `/workspace`. Pushed downward as a `PaletteContext` value the palette and `when` predicates consume.

This is one of two coupling points between the palette and the rest of the app (the other is per-page command registration via the hook). Pages do **not** need to know the palette exists — they just register their commands.

## 3. Search and ranking

Filter is single-token-substring, case-insensitive, applied to `title + ' ' + (subtitle ?? '') + ' ' + (keywords ?? []).join(' ')`. No fuzzy matching in v1 (subjective tradeoff: substring is predictable and fast, fuzzy ranking adds tunables we don't need yet).

Ranking, in order:
1. Recently used (MRU bucket, oldest at the bottom of its bucket).
2. Title prefix match (`q === title.slice(0, q.length)` lowercase).
3. Title substring match.
4. Subtitle / keywords substring match.

Within each rank bucket, preserve the registration order (which roughly tracks importance: ConnectionManager registers global commands first, then page-specific commands register).

When MRU pulls a command into the RECENT bucket, that command does **not** also appear under its own group — it moves, not duplicates. This matches VS Code / Linear behavior and avoids two same-named rows on screen.

Empty query → render the RECENT bucket first (if non-empty), then every other command grouped by `group`. Section headers in registration order: `general`, `navigation`, `connection`, `workspace`, `query`, `view`, `references`, `aggregation`.

## 4. UI

- 520 px wide, max 460 px tall (matches the existing `CmdKStub` dimensions for visual continuity).
- Modal-style overlay: full-viewport backdrop at `rgba(0,0,0,0.45)`, palette centered ~100 px from top.
- Click on the backdrop dismisses; click inside the palette does not bubble.
- Focus the input on open. Restore focus to the previously focused element on close.

### Keyboard

| Key             | Behavior                                                               |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` | Toggle the palette.                                                    |
| `Esc`           | Close.                                                                 |
| `↓` / `↑`       | Move the cursor through visible rows (wraps).                          |
| `Enter`         | Perform the cursor row's command.                                      |
| `⌘↵`            | Same as `Enter`. Reserved for power users who already chord with `⌘`. |
| `Home` / `End`  | Jump cursor to first / last visible row.                               |

`Tab` is intentionally unbound: the palette's only focusable element is its input, so the default browser behavior (no-op on Tab) is the desired outcome. The palette never traps `⌘W`, `⌘T`, `⌘1`–`⌘9`, or other workspace shortcuts — those listeners are owned by their own components and don't fire while the palette is open because the palette's input absorbs typing. The palette's global listener at `document` level intercepts only `⌘K`/`Ctrl+K` (open/close) and `Esc` (close), and only the latter when the palette is open.

### Empty / no-result states

- No commands registered → render "No actions available here yet." (defensive — should never happen in practice because global commands always register).
- Query with no matches → `No matches for "<query>"` muted text.

### Visual style

- Match the existing `CmdKStub`: surface = `T.surface`, border = `T.borderMed`, headers = `T.textGhost` uppercase 10 px, rows = 12 px text, hover = `T.surfaceRaised`, selected (cursor) row = `T.surfaceRaised` + 2 px left accent in `T.accent`.
- Group headers always visible above their (filtered) rows; hide the header if the group has zero matches.
- Shortcut badge right-aligned in the row, monospace, 11 px, muted.

## 5. v1 command catalog

> **Amended** (ADR [0001](../docs/adr/0001-data-view-home-connection-switcher.md)): the
> `/connections` list-sidebar screen this table was written against is retired, and
> `PaletteContext.connectionId` now falls back to the Active Connection off the deep detail screen
> — see the row-level notes below for what changed. The rest of this table (workspace/query/view/
> aggregation commands) is unaffected.

| Group         | Id                          | Title                             | When                                                                                  | Performs                                                              |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| general       | `settings.open`             | Open settings                     | always                                                                                | opens `<SettingsModal>` — see §11 for the prerequisite hoist           |
| navigation    | ~~`nav.connections`~~       | ~~Go to connections~~             | **Removed** — `/connections` no longer has a screen to navigate to (it redirects to `/workspace`). | —                                                                       |
| navigation    | `nav.workspace`             | Go to workspace                   | `pathname !== '/workspace'` and `connectionId` set (URL id, or the Active Connection off the deep screen) | `navigate('/workspace')`                                               |
| connection    | `connection.new`            | New connection                    | always                                                                                | `navigate('/connections/new')`                                         |
| connection    | `connection.edit`           | Edit selected connection          | `connectionId` set (URL id on the deep screen, or the Active Connection from the Data View, no longer a `pathname` prefix check) | `navigate('/connections/:id/edit', { state: { returnTo: pathname } })` — `returnTo` lands save/cancel back where the command was invoked from, not always the deep screen |
| connection    | `connection.delete`         | Delete selected connection        | `connectionId` set                                                                    | On the deep screen: opens `ConnectionManager`'s delete-confirm dialog. On the Data View: opens the same dialog via `Workspace.tsx`'s `openDeleteConnectionModal`, acting on the Active Connection — the two registrations share the id but the routes are mutually exclusive |
| connection    | `connection.refresh`        | Refresh connection list           | `pathname.startsWith('/connections')` (deep screen) or `pathname === '/workspace'` (Data View) | `useConnections().refresh()` — registered separately by whichever of `ConnectionManager.tsx` / `Workspace.tsx` is mounted, each capturing its own hook instance |
| connection    | `connection.switch:<id>`    | `Switch to: <name>`               | always; one row per connection (subtitle = host)                                      | navigates to `/workspace` with a `switchConnectionId` intent that `Workspace` runs via `switchConnection` — registered globally by `<ConnectionPaletteCommands>`, which holds its own `useConnections()` subscription |
| workspace     | `tab.new`                   | New tab…                          | `pathname === '/workspace'` and active connection exists                              | opens the existing `<NewTabModal>` (`setNewTabOpen(true)`)             |
| workspace     | `tab.new.aggregation`       | New aggregation tab on this coll. | `activeTab?.kind === 'collection'`                                                    | `tabs.openAggregation({connectionId, dbName, collection})` from the active tab's coords (no modal) |
| workspace     | `tab.open:<db>:<coll>`      | `Open: <db>.<coll>`               | always while on `/workspace` with a browsing connection — one row per collection in every non-system db | `tabs.openCollection({connectionId, dbName, collection, reuseExisting: true})` — switches to an existing tab if one exists, otherwise creates a fresh one. Mirrors the navigator's plain-click behavior. Per-connection collection list is fetched once on mount + on browsing-connection change via `meta:listDatabases` + `meta:listCollections` (independent subscription from the navigator) |
| workspace     | `tab.close`                 | Close current tab                 | `activeTab !== null`                                                                  | `tabs.close(activeTab.id)` from `useWorkspaceTabs`                     |
| workspace     | `tab.pin.toggle`            | Pin current tab / Unpin           | `activeTab !== null` (title flips on `activeTab.pinned`)                              | `tabs.setPinned(activeTab.id, !activeTab.pinned)`                      |

| view          | `view.mode.tree`            | Show results as Tree              | `activeTab?.kind === 'collection'` and `state.view !== 'Tree'`                        | `tabs.patchCollectionState(activeTab.id, { view: 'Tree' })`            |

| aggregation   | `agg.explain`               | Explain pipeline                  | `activeTab?.kind === 'aggregation'`                                                   | opens explain drawer                                                   |
| aggregation   | `agg.save`                  | Save pipeline                     | `activeTab?.kind === 'aggregation'`                                                   | opens save modal                                                       |

The `activeTab?.kind === '…'` predicates above are conceptual — the implementation enforces them structurally via registration scope: the collection-tab subtree only mounts when `activeTab.kind === 'collection'`, so its `query.*` / `view.mode.*` / `references.configure` registrations only exist while the predicate would be true. The same applies to `agg.*`. No `when` clause needs to read `activeTab` at runtime, which is why `PaletteContext` doesn't carry it.

`shortcut` is set on commands that already have a keyboard binding elsewhere (e.g., `tab.new` shows `⌘T`). The palette never installs shortcuts; it only displays them.

Commands marked "always" + `connection.new` + `nav.*` register once globally from `App.tsx`. Page- and tab-scoped commands are registered by the component that owns the action — that way `perform` is a closure over the live state setters/handlers in scope:

- `ConnectionManager.tsx` registers `connection.delete` (closure over `setDeleteConfirmOpen`) and `connection.refresh` (closure over `useConnections().refresh`) for the deep detail screen. `connection.edit` stays global because it's pure nav. `Workspace.tsx` now *also* registers `connection.delete` / `connection.refresh` (against the Active Connection) so they're offered from the Data View too — the routes never overlap, so there's no id collision at runtime.
- `Workspace.tsx` registers `tab.new` (closure over `setNewTabOpen`), `tab.new.aggregation` (closure over `tabs.openAggregation` + the active tab's coords), `tab.close`, `tab.pin.toggle`, and `references.configure` (closure over `setRefEditorOpen`).
- The collection-tab subtree (currently the body of `Workspace.tsx` when `activeTab.kind === 'collection'` — could become `<CollectionTabBody>` during this work) registers `query.run` (closure over `run`), `query.save` (closure over the SaveModal opener), `query.copy`, and the three `view.mode.*` commands.
- The aggregation-tab subtree registers `agg.run`, `agg.explain`, `agg.save` against the active aggregation tab's local handlers.

When the owning component unmounts, the commands disappear from the palette automatically.

`connection.switch:<id>` is dynamic: a single `useRegisterCommands` call inside a global `<ConnectionPaletteCommands>` component derives one Command per row of its own `useConnections()` subscription.

## 6. Behavior rules

- **One palette only.** Two `⌘K` presses with the palette already open does NOT stack; it closes.
- **Performs are best-effort.** A `perform` that throws logs a dev-only `console.error`. The palette closes anyway; no error UI takes over the screen. (A toast is intentionally omitted in v1 — a failing command is rare and the user can read the dev console; adding a toast layer here just to handle this case is overkill.)
- **No persistence.** MRU and pinned-command preferences (future) are session-only in v1. Closing and reopening the app forgets MRU. This is on purpose: MRU persisted across releases would surface stale command ids after refactors.
- **Hints stay behind the backdrop.** The palette's full-viewport backdrop visually covers any X06 hint that would otherwise be visible. No explicit suppression API is needed — the `rgba(0,0,0,0.45)` overlay handles it.

## 7. Persistence

None for v1. No new `app_state` keys, no migrations, no IPC.

If a future iteration wants persistent MRU, the obvious shape is a single `app_state['ui.commandPalette.mru']` key holding `string[]`, validated against the live registry at load time (drop unknown ids).

## 8. Error handling

- A command registered with a duplicate id replaces the previous one and warns once (dev). No throw — registration races during HMR are common.
- A command whose `when` throws is treated as `false` and warned once.
- A command whose `perform` throws or rejects logs and toasts as in §6.
- The palette never holds the user hostage: Esc always closes regardless of the cursor row's state.

## 9. Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `⌘K` (`Ctrl+K` on non-mac) opens the palette from any route. Pressing it again closes it.
- [ ] Esc closes the palette and restores focus to the previously focused element.
- [ ] Typing filters the catalog by case-insensitive substring across `title`, `subtitle`, and `keywords`.
- [ ] Arrow keys move a visible cursor; Enter performs the command; performing closes the palette.
- [ ] Performing a command bumps it to the top of the session MRU and the palette shows it under a "RECENT" header on next open.
- [ ] **Superseded** — `/connections` no longer exists as a screen; `New connection` and every `Switch to: <name>` row are offered from `/workspace` (the Data View, now home) instead.
- [ ] On `/connections/:id` (deep detail screen, reached only via the Switcher's "Manage connection…"), the palette includes `Edit selected connection` and `Delete selected connection`. Both are now also offered from `/workspace`, acting on the Active Connection.
- [ ] On `/workspace` with a collection tab active, the palette includes `Run query`, `Save query`, `Configure references`, two `view.mode.*` toggles (only the non-current ones), `New aggregation tab on this coll.`, and `Pin current tab` / `Unpin current tab` matching the active tab's `pinned` flag.
- [ ] On `/workspace` with an aggregation tab active, the palette includes `Run pipeline`, `Explain pipeline`, `Save pipeline`. Collection-only commands (`Run query`, `view.mode.*`) are hidden.
- [ ] Closing a workspace tab removes the tab-scoped commands from the palette on the next open without a reload.
- [ ] The previous `CmdKStub` is removed; `ConnectionManager.tsx` no longer owns the `⌘K` keyboard listener or the dialog markup.
- [ ] The X06 `refs.configure` hint's CTA and the `references.configure` palette command call the same `setRefEditorOpen` setter from `Workspace.tsx` (verified by both being closures over the same component scope).
- [ ] A `perform` that throws does not crash the renderer; the palette closes and the error reaches `console.error`.

## 10. Test cases

### Unit

- `commands-registry.spec.ts` — `add` / `list` / `subscribe`; duplicate ids replace and warn once; multiple `add` calls compose; the unregister fn returned by `add` removes only what it added.
- `commands-rank.spec.ts` — fixture catalog + queries → expected order. Covers MRU precedence, prefix > substring, keyword fallback.
- `commands-when.spec.ts` — `when` returning false hides the command; `when` throwing is treated as false and warns once.

### Component

- `command-palette-shell.spec.tsx` — `⌘K` opens, Esc closes, click-outside closes; focus restored.
- `command-palette-keyboard.spec.tsx` — arrow keys move cursor, Enter performs and closes.
- `command-palette-search.spec.tsx` — typing filters; group headers hide when empty; "no matches" copy.
- `command-palette-mru.spec.tsx` — performing twice in a row leaves the command at the top of RECENT.
- `register-commands.spec.tsx` — `useRegisterCommands` registers on mount, unregisters on unmount, replaces on `deps` change.
- `palette-context.spec.tsx` — context exposes the right `pathname` / `connectionId` / `activeTab` for each route fixture.

### E2E

- `palette-connections.e2e.ts` — fresh launch → `⌘K` → search "new" → Enter → lands on `/connections/new`.
- `palette-workspace.e2e.ts` — open a collection tab → `⌘K` → search "json" → Enter → result view switches to JSON. Then `⌘K` → search "save" → Enter → SaveModal opens.
- `palette-aggregation.e2e.ts` — open an aggregation tab → `⌘K` → only `agg.*` commands appear under AGGREGATION; `Run query` is absent.
- `palette-mru.e2e.ts` — perform `Run query`, close + reopen palette, RECENT row is at the top.

## 11. Implementation order

Lands in three commits, each independently mergeable:

1. **Extract + registry, no behavior change.**
   - New files: `src/commands/{types.ts, registry.ts, useRegisterCommands.ts, PaletteContext.tsx, CommandPalette.tsx, GlobalCommands.tsx, ConnectionPaletteCommands.tsx}`.
   - Mount the palette + the `<PaletteContextProvider>` + `<GlobalCommands>` + `<ConnectionPaletteCommands>` in `App.tsx`.
   - Hoist `<SettingsModal>` mount + `settingsOpen` state from `Workspace.tsx` to `App.tsx` (or to a sibling provider) so the global `settings.open` command can open it from any route. The existing `onOpenSettings` prop stays — it now calls a context-provided opener instead of a local setter.
   - Move the `⌘K` listener and dialog markup out of `ConnectionManager.tsx`. The `<TitleBar>` `⌘K` button stays — it dispatches the same toggle the keyboard listener does (via the palette's open/close API exposed on the registry context).
   - Register the existing `connection.new` (global), `theme.toggle` (global), `settings.open` (global), and the dynamic `connection.switch:<id>` rows. Visual parity with today's `CmdKStub`.
   - Tests: registry unit, register-commands hook, shell component, search/keyboard component.
2. **Workspace + connection-context commands.**
   - In `ConnectionManager.tsx`, register `connection.delete` (closure over `setDeleteConfirmOpen`) and `connection.refresh`.
   - In `Workspace.tsx`, register `tab.new`, `tab.new.aggregation`, `tab.close`, `tab.pin.toggle`, and `references.configure`.
   - In the collection-tab subtree, register `query.run`, `query.save`, `query.copy`, and the three `view.mode.*` toggles. (Extract `<CollectionTabBody>` if needed to scope the registrations to the active collection tab; otherwise gate via `when` on `activeTab.kind`.)
   - In the aggregation-tab subtree, register `agg.run`, `agg.explain`, `agg.save`.
   - Tests: palette-context, palette-aggregation E2E, palette-workspace E2E.
3. **MRU + polish.** Session MRU, perform-failure logging, copy review, accessibility pass (`role="dialog"` `aria-modal="true"`, listbox semantics on the result list). Tests: MRU unit + component, palette-mru E2E.

## 12. Risks and mitigations

- **Closure staleness in `useRegisterCommands`.** Same risk as `useCallback` — wrong `deps` array → palette runs an old `perform`. Mitigation: extend `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` via the `additionalHooks` ESLint config to lint our hook (one-line config addition). Component test that switches the active tab and runs the registered command catches the worst regression.
- **Registry leaks during HMR.** Vite HMR can re-mount components without unmounting the previous instance. Mitigation: registry's `add` overwrites by id (a re-mount registers the same id and replaces the closure rather than duplicating).
- **Shortcut conflicts.** `⌘K` is unused today (`CmdKStub` already claims it). `Tab` inside the palette traps focus only while open. No other keys are claimed.
- **Palette opening from a textarea.** `⌘K` should still open even if a `<textarea>` is focused. Mitigation: install the listener on `document`, not on a contained element; do not check `e.target.tagName`. Verify with the query-bar textarea in tests.
