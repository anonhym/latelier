# W12 — Script editor tab

## Purpose

Give users a workspace tab where they can write a multi-statement
JavaScript/Mongo script, run the whole buffer against the active
connection, and see the result rendered as structured output (not a
stdout stream). Complements W11 (the in-process REPL pane): same
in-process Mongo execution model, different surface — write-and-run
instead of read-eval-print.

The script editor is the right tool when the work is "compose a few
lines, iterate, save, share"; the shell pane is the right tool when
the work is "poke the cluster one expression at a time".

## Scope

- **In**: a `'script'` workspace tab kind backed by
  `workspace_tabs.state_json`; a CodeMirror 6 editor in the renderer
  with JS syntax highlighting; a `ScriptService` in main that runs the
  script in a `node:vm` context wrapping the user buffer in an async
  IIFE; IPC channels `script:run` / `script:cancel`; structured result
  rendering (last expression value + a print buffer); cancellation via
  `AbortController` keyed on a cancel token.
- **Out**: persisting scripts as named/saved entities (covered by a
  future `W13-saved-scripts.md`); multi-file imports / `require()`;
  scheduled / repeating runs; sharing scripts across connections.

## Why a tab (not the W11 pane)

W11 already exposes a stdin/stdout REPL with the exact same backing
machinery. A script editor is a *different* UX problem:

1. **Editing affordance.** Multi-line composition with syntax
   highlighting and key-bindings beats a single-line `<input>`.
2. **Result shape.** Users want to see the *return value* of their
   script as a typed, navigable structure — a table when it's an array
   of docs, a JSON tree when it's a `UpdateResult` — not a
   monospaced text stream.
3. **Lifecycle.** A tab persists per-workspace (the buffer survives
   relaunch via `state_json`); the W11 pane is intentionally
   ephemeral.

The two surfaces share the `db` proxy and the `MongoPool` integration
point — execution is identical, only the UX differs.

## Dependencies

- C02 (`Connection`), F04 (IPC pattern), F05 (`MongoPool` —
  `getClient(connectionId)`), W01 (workspace tab model), W11
  (`ShellService` — the `db` proxy / collection-alias helpers are
  extracted and reused).

## 1. Types

```ts
// shared/types.ts

export type WorkspaceTabKind = 'collection' | 'script';

export interface ScriptTabState {
  /** Editor buffer. UTF-8. */
  source: string;
  /** Selected database for the `db` proxy at run time. Optional —
   *  scripts can also explicitly call `use("...")`. */
  dbName?: string;
  /** Last successful run's result, kept so the tab restores with its
   *  most recent output after relaunch. */
  lastResult?: ScriptRunResultWire;
  /** Last error, if the last run failed. Mutually exclusive with
   *  lastResult. */
  lastError?: { code: string; message: string };
}

export interface ScriptRunInput {
  connectionId: string;
  dbName?: string;
  source: string;
  /** Renderer-supplied UUID; used by `script:cancel`. */
  cancelToken?: string;
  /** Hard ceiling so a runaway script can't pin the main process.
   *  Defaults to 60_000 ms. User-selectable per-tab via a toolbar
   *  knob: 15s / 60s / 5min / no limit (≈24 h). */
  maxTimeMs?: number;
  /** EJSON canonical (false) vs relaxed (true). Default false to
   *  match the rest of the app. */
  ejsonRelaxed?: boolean;
}

export interface ScriptRunResultWire {
  /** EJSON-encoded last-expression value. May be a JSON array,
   *  object, or scalar. `null` when the script produced no value. */
  valueJson: string | null;
  /** Concatenated `print()` / `printjson()` output, capped at 64 KB.
   *  Empty string when the script did not call print. */
  printBuffer: string;
  durationMs: number;
}
```

## 2. IPC channels

| Channel         | Input             | Output                | Notes |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ----- |
| `script:run`    | `ScriptRunInput`  | `ScriptRunResultWire` | runs the buffer in a fresh `vm.Context`. Throws `MongoOpError` / `ValidationError` / `SystemError`. |
| `script:cancel` | `{ token: string }` | `void`              | aborts the AbortController bound to that token. No-op if unknown. |

No `SECRET_INPUT` tag — credentials never cross the boundary; the
script binds to the already-authenticated `MongoClient` from the
pool.

## 3. ScriptService (main)

```ts
class ScriptService {
  run(input: ScriptRunInput): Promise<ScriptRunResultWire>;
  cancel(token: string): void;
}
```

Behaviour:

- `run` calls `pool.getClient(connectionId)` first so connect failures
  surface cleanly before any vm allocation.
- A fresh `vm.Context` is created per call. The context globals are:
  - `db` — the same Proxy `ShellService` builds (extracted to
    `electron/mongo/dbProxy.ts` so both services share one
    implementation). Mongosh-style aliases (`runCommand` →
    `command`, `count` → `countDocuments`) carry over.
  - `use(name)` — switches the proxy's current database.
  - `print(...args)` / `printjson(value)` — append to the print
    buffer (capped at 64 KB; further writes are silently dropped to
    keep the IPC payload bounded).
  - `EJSON` — re-export of `bson.EJSON`.
  - `ObjectId`, `ISODate`, `Long`, `Decimal128`, `UUID` — re-exports
    of `bson` constructors so users can write `new ObjectId(...)`
    just as they would in mongosh.
  - `signal` — the AbortController's `signal`, exposed as a global
    so users can pass it manually to long-running ops. The collection
    proxy *also* auto-threads it: when the user calls
    `db.coll.find(filter)` (no options), the wrapper rewrites that to
    `find(filter, { signal })`. If the user passes their own options
    object, theirs wins (so explicit `{ signal: undefined }` opts
    out). Same treatment for `findOne`, `aggregate`,
    `countDocuments`, `updateOne`, `updateMany`, `deleteOne`,
    `deleteMany`, `insertOne`, `insertMany`, and cursor `.toArray()`.
- The buffer is wrapped in an async IIFE before evaluation:
  ```js
  (async () => {
    <user source>
  })()
  ```
  The Promise it returns is awaited. Top-level `await` works because
  the wrapper is async.
- `vm.runInContext(wrapped, ctx, { timeout: maxTimeMs, breakOnSigint: true })`
  enforces a hard ceiling. The timeout interrupts CPU-bound user code;
  the AbortController interrupts driver-bound waits.
- The "result value" is the last expression of the script. The
  wrapper parses the source with `acorn` (pure-JS, no native deps);
  if the final top-level statement is an `ExpressionStatement` it is
  prefixed with `return ` before evaluation. Anything else
  (assignments, declarations) produces no value, and `valueJson` is
  `null`. If acorn fails to parse, the source is run as-is and
  `valueJson` stays `null` — the syntax error surfaces from the vm
  with the user's original line/column, not the wrapper's. Mirrors
  how Node's REPL surfaces the last expression without forcing users
  to write `return`.
- The returned value is EJSON-encoded via the existing
  `ejsonEncode` (objects/arrays) or `ejsonStringifyRelaxed` helpers.
  Non-serialisable values (functions, the `db` proxy itself) collapse
  to `null` — the print buffer is the escape hatch for those.
- `cancel(token)` aborts the controller and removes it from the
  `active` map. Idempotent.

### Sandboxing posture

`vm.createContext` is *not* a security boundary — user scripts run
with full Node primordials reachable via the host. This matches the
threat model of W11 (the user's own code, run on the user's own
machine, against the user's own database). `isolated-vm` is rejected
on the same grounds as in W11: native ABI complications on top of
`better-sqlite3`, and no actual security gain for a single-user
desktop tool.

## 4. Renderer surface

### 4.1 Tab kind

`WorkspaceTabKind` extends to `'collection' | 'script'`. The existing
tab strip already keys on `kind`; a new icon (`{I.code}`) and label
("Script") are added. New-script creation lives behind a "+ Script"
entry in the same overflow menu the workspace already uses for "+
Collection" tabs.

### 4.2 `ScriptTab.tsx`

Layout: vertical split, editor on top, result panel on the bottom,
`ResizeHandle` between (height ratio persisted in `state_json` so the
split survives relaunch).

- **Editor**: a `<ScriptEditor>` component wrapping CodeMirror 6 with
  `@codemirror/lang-javascript`, the project's existing dark/light
  theme tokens, and a controlled `value` / `onChange` API. Buffer
  changes flow through the same 250 ms-debounced
  `api.tabs.update({ stateJson })` path the rest of the workspace
  uses.
- **Run / Cancel toolbar**: Run is `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter`. While a run is
  in flight the button flips to Cancel and dispatches
  `script:cancel`.
- **Result panel**: branches by result shape.
  - **Array** → reuse the W06 result components (`TreeView` /
    `JsonView` / `TableView`) with a Tree / JSON / Table toggle
    persisted per-tab as `state.resultView`. Column widths and tree
    row-expansion state also round-trip through `state_json`
    (`resultColumns`, `resultExpandedRows`). When the array is
    not all records (e.g. `db.coll.distinct(...)`) only the JSON
    view is enabled.
  - **Single record** → reuse `JsonView` with a one-element array;
    no toggle.
  - **Scalar / `null` / `undefined`** → small inline `<pre>` with
    EJSON pretty-print.
  Before the first run the panel collapses to a one-line hint bar so
  the editor gets the full viewport; once a result or error is
  present it expands to the persisted height.
  The print buffer renders below the value as a collapsed `<pre>`
  (auto-expanded when non-empty).
- **Status row**: connection name, db name (with a dropdown to
  override), duration, error code (when applicable).

### 4.3 No new editor anywhere else (yet)

CodeMirror 6 is introduced *only* in `ScriptTab.tsx`. The query bar,
filter input, and aggregation stage editor keep their existing
textarea + autocomplete hook. Migrating those is out of scope and
tracked as a follow-up in GitHub Issues.

## 5. Security

- No credentials cross the IPC boundary. The script binds to the
  already-authenticated `MongoClient` from the pool.
- The script has the same database authority the rest of the app has —
  no privilege escalation, no impersonation.
- All evaluation happens in the **main** process. The renderer only
  sees the structured wire result.
- Bundled hard timeout (`maxTimeMs`) caps CPU-bound runaway code; the
  AbortController caps driver-bound waits.

## 6. Acceptance criteria

- [x] Opening a Script tab shows an empty CodeMirror 6 editor with JS
      syntax highlighting and the project's theme.
- [x] `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` runs the buffer; the result panel renders the
      last expression value.
- [x] `db.users.find().toArray()` produces a renderable array result
      using the existing `ResultTable` (Tree / JSON / Table toggle,
      same components as the W06 collection result area).
- [x] `print("hi")` appears in the print buffer below the value.
- [x] An infinite loop (`while (true) {}`) is killed by the
      `maxTimeMs` ceiling; the renderer shows a `SystemError` with a
      clear "script exceeded N ms" message.
- [x] Cancelling a long `find` (large collection, no index) via the
      Cancel button aborts within ~1 s.
- [x] Closing and reopening the app restores the buffer text and the
      most recent result/error from `state_json`.
- [x] EJSON round-trips (an `ObjectId` written in the buffer comes
      back as `$oid` in the result, and renders as `ObjectId(...)` in
      the table).

## 7. Test cases

### Unit (main)
- **script-service.spec.ts** (vm semantics): last-expression capture,
  `print` buffering + cap, top-level `await`, `maxTimeMs` interrupts
  a `while(true)`, syntax errors throw `ValidationError`, runtime
  errors throw `MongoOpError` (or `SystemError` for non-Mongo).

### Integration (main + memory Mongo)
- **script-handler.spec.ts**: drives `script:run` against
  `mongodb-memory-server`. Covers a `find().toArray()` round-trip
  through EJSON, `cancel` aborts an in-flight `find`, `dbName`
  override is respected, the `db` proxy and the W11 shell agree on
  the same expression's output.

### Component
- **script-tab.spec.tsx**: mounts `<ScriptTab>` against a mocked
  `api.script`. Verifies `Cmd+Enter` invokes `script.run` with the
  buffer, the result table renders an array result, the print
  buffer renders below the value, Cancel calls `script.cancel`,
  buffer changes flow through `api.tabs.update`.

### E2E
- **script-editor.e2e.ts**: launches the real Electron app, seeds a
  connection against an in-memory MongoDB, opens a Script tab,
  types `db.users.insertOne({ name: "x" }); db.users.find().toArray();`,
  hits Cmd+Enter, asserts the document appears in the table and
  survives a relaunch.
