 * cancel, or app quit. A script that never yields can therefore only ever
 * stall its own process, never the main one.
 *
 * The runner holds no database client and no credentials. Its `db` sends every
 * call back as an RPC frame, and `rpcHost` executes it here over the pool's own
 * client, through the read-only guard, with the flag read live from the
 * connection. That is what makes read-only a property of main rather than of
 * the script's process.
 *
 * Main also keeps the pieces that must survive a runner: the cancel-token
 * bookkeeping, the connect pre-flight (clean connect errors, connection status
 * events) and the wall-clock timer.
