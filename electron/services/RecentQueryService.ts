   * excluded a field with `{"secret":0}` ran with **no projection at all** and
   * put the excluded field back on screen, silently. The run in the history
   * list was not the run you got.
   *
   * `projection` and `sort` are the compiled strings that actually executed, so
   * storing the projection as `projectionRaw` reproduces the exact query — raw
   * wins in `compileFindOptions`, and main cannot recover the modelled field
   * list from a compiled document anyway.
   *
   * `limit` is deliberately NOT recorded. `FindInput.limit` is the *effective*
   * page limit from `effectivePageLimit`, not the user's cap, so storing it
   * would make a rerun silently inherit the page size of whichever page the
   * original run happened to be on.
