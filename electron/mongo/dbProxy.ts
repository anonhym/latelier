/**
 * Shared `db` proxy used by both the W11 shell pane (`ShellService`) and the
 * W12 script editor (`ScriptService`). Exposes the live `MongoClient`
 * through a mongosh-flavoured surface:
 *
 *   db                     → the current database name
 *   db.<collName>          → a Collection (with mongosh→driver method aliases)
 *   db.runCommand(...)     → driver `db.command(...)`
 *   db.getSiblingDB(name)  → a new proxy scoped to `name`, current `db` unchanged
 *
 * `ctx.currentDb` is mutable so callers can switch the active database (e.g.
 * `use("foo")`) without rebuilding the proxy. An optional `signal` is
 * auto-threaded into:
 *   - collection ops that accept `Abortable` (find, findOne, aggregate,
 *     update*, delete*, etc.) — missing positionals are padded with
 *     `undefined` so common calls like `find()` still get the signal;
 *   - cursor-returning ops — the cursor is proxied so terminal methods
 *     (`toArray`, `forEach`, `next`, …) inherit the signal too.
 *
 * The user's options object wins: if they passed `{ signal: x }` (even
 * `signal: undefined`), the wrapper steps aside.
 *
 * When `ctx.isReadOnly` is set (script pane only — see ADR 0005 for why the
 * shell pane refuses its whole session instead of relying on this), every
 * collection method not in READ_COLL_METHODS throws, and `aggregate`
 * additionally rejects a pipeline containing `$out`/`$merge`. Every direct
 * `Db` method other than `collection` (`dropDatabase`, `createCollection`,
 * `command`/`runCommand`, `admin`, etc.) throws outright — there's no way to
 * classify an arbitrary `runCommand` payload as read-only-safe, so the
 * default under read-only is deny.

 * of it. Confirmed by probe on a Connection that was read-only the whole
 * time: a descriptor read of `s` on a collection, and of `cursorClient` on a
 * cursor, each produced a real write. The script VM exposes the standard
 * `Object` intrinsic, so this is ordinary reachable script code.
 *
 * Returning the same value `get` would return closes it. An accessor
 * descriptor carries no `value` to guard and passes through; the driver keeps
 * none of its state that way.
 *
 * Non-configurable is where this gets sharp, because a script chooses it:
 * `Object.seal`/`Object.freeze` on a guarded handle forward to the target
 * through the default integrity traps and make the driver's own `s` bag
 * non-configurable. Bailing out on `configurable === false` — which this did —
 * then handed back the raw value on request. Probed against a real server with
 * `isReadOnly()` true throughout: `Object.seal(db.items)` followed by a
 * descriptor read of `s` returned the live `Db` and the insert came back
 * `acknowledged`.
 *
 * The invariant is narrower than that bail-out assumed. [[GetOwnProperty]]
 * only pins the value when the target property is non-configurable **and**
 * non-writable; `seal` leaves `writable` alone, so a sealed property can still
 * be reported guarded. `freeze` clears it, and then no guarded value can be
 * reported at all — returning one makes the engine throw `TypeError`. That
 * case refuses explicitly instead: an opaque engine error and a leaked write
 * surface are both worse than saying which rule stopped the script.
