 * Undo compares against before putting `preImage` back); bulk ops use the
 * plural arrays, paired by index; `insertMany` keeps the documents it
 * inserted — the Node driver assigns `_id` onto each input document in
 * place unless `forceServerObjectId` is set (neither `insertMany` call sets
 * it), so the same array holds the ids after the write with no second read;
 * `collectionRename` keeps the two names; `import` keeps only ids plus a
 * per-document digest (X13 §5's option (b)) — a full-body capture like
 * `insertedDocs` would be tens of MB at the ~10,000-document ceiling `import`
 * needs, well past `insertMany`'s ≤1000/≤1MB bulk capture.
