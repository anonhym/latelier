 * schema of the row's `kind`, and `saved:update` to the stored row's.
 *
 * Objects are loose on purpose: this checks the payload, it does not rewrite
 * it. `builder` keeps keys it does not name, such as the `conditions` / `logic`
 * the legacy filter shim compiles a pre-`queryRaw` filter from. `queryRaw` is
 * optional because W09 §1 types it so and rows saved before it existed lack it.
