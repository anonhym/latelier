# Changelog

All notable changes to L'Atelier.

This file is the durable record. GitHub Releases carries the same history for
now, but release metadata does not travel with the source, so anything that
matters long-term belongs here.

Two things to know when reading the older entries:

- **Entries up to and including 0.14.0 are the commit subjects as written at
  the time**, grouped by the tag that shipped them and dated by that tag. They
  were not rewritten into user-facing prose after the fact, because rewriting
  them later would mean inventing intent the commits do not record.
- **The `(#nnn)` numbers in those entries point at the repository this project
  was developed in before it was published.** They are part of the original
  commit subjects and are kept for provenance; they do not resolve against this
  repository's issues.

Entries from 0.15.0 onward follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.0] — 2026-09-23

### Added

- **Keyboard operability across the custom controls (N2).** Every control that
  used to need a mouse now works from the keyboard alone:
  - The result views (Table, Tree, and each document's field tree) and the
    connection navigator are one tab stop each. Arrow keys, Home and End move
    an active row that assistive tech hears through `aria-activedescendant` and
    sighted users see as an outline. Enter activates the row, and a long jump
    keeps the row fully in view.
  - Context menus open with Shift+F10 or the ContextMenu key, including the
    field menu in the document tree (Copy value, Copy field path, Add to filter).
  - Table headers carry `aria-sort`, and their actions appear on focus as well
    as on hover.
  - Expandable rows in the Indexes and Users tabs, the column chooser's
    reordering, the resize separators, and the connection form's tabs are all
    keyboard-operable. The tabs are now a real tablist.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, issue and pull-request templates,
  and `CODEOWNERS`.
- Self-hosted Inter and JetBrains Mono. The app makes no third-party font
  request at runtime, and the SIL OFL licence texts ship with the build.
- E2E now runs in CI on `main` and on pull requests targeting it, rather than
  only on manual dispatch.

### Security

- **The renderer now runs under a Content-Security-Policy**, served as a header
  so the shipped policy can be stricter than the development one. It makes no
  third-party connection, loads no remote script, and can embed no frame.
- **Child windows are denied** and **top-level navigation off the app's own
  document is refused.** Either one would have replaced the privileged renderer
  while leaving the preload bridge attached. Both are judged by parsed location
  rather than string prefix — `http://host:port@evil.example/` and
  `file:///tmp/anything.html` both defeat a prefix test.
- **Every IPC request is validated against the sending frame** before it
  reaches a handler, and answers `UNTRUSTED_SENDER` if it fails.
- **The renderer is sandboxed** (`sandbox: true`).
- **A packaged build no longer writes the payload of every IPC request to a log
  file on disk.** That meant document contents, query filters and shell input,
  for every user, by default. The level now keys off `app.isPackaged`; the
  previous `NODE_ENV` check could never be true in a shipped app.
- **A packaged build no longer binds Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R to deleting the
  database** — the same unreachable `NODE_ENV` check guarded the developer
  reset shortcut.
- Development-only: three moderate `qs` advisories that reached the lockfile
  through Stryker are resolved with a scoped override.

### Fixed

- **The title bar drags the window across its whole empty middle again.** The
  connection switcher's wrapper was `flex: 1` and `no-drag` at once, so only a
  narrow strip of the bar could drag the window.
- **Focus is no longer dropped on the page body.** Closing a popover with
  Escape, dismissing a context menu, a successful create, rename or drop in the
  navigator and in the Indexes and Users tabs, and a failed submit whose dialog
  stays open all leave focus on a sensible control.
- **Double-clicking a table cell with nothing selected copied the row above.**
  The first click's selection bar pushed the grid down between the two clicks.
  The bar's space is now always reserved.
- The copy-confirmation flash no longer hides the active-row outline, and its
  mark follows the right field inside nested subtrees.
- A field name containing a dot no longer collides with a nested field of the
  same path in the document tree.
- Arrow keys skip loading, empty and error placeholder rows in the navigator.
- Actions in CI are pinned to commit SHAs rather than mutable tags.

### Removed

- `BACKLOG.md`. Known gaps and follow-ups live in GitHub Issues; a checked-in
  list and an issue tracker always drift, and the file lost.
