    // gap shipped in the connection-switcher redesign (caught in code
    // review): the popover's shortcut legend was cut down on the premise
    // that "the rest are taught by the row-action tooltips," which wasn't
    // true until this default changed. Set once, here, rather than per call
    // site — every Tooltip in the app (there were 39, none opting into
    // `focus: true` individually) gets the fix, and nobody has to remember
    // to ask for it on the next one.

    // `Modal`/`Drawer` renders its ✕ through it, so any dialog that didn't pass
    // `closeButtonProps` had a close control a screen reader announced as bare
    // "button". Twelve of the fourteen were in that state.
    //
    // Set here for the same reason as `Tooltip` above: the per-call-site fix
    // works but has to be remembered on the next dialog, and X15 is the epic
    // that exists because a dozen dialogs each independently forgot the same
    // handful of details. A theme default cannot be forgotten.
    //
    // Call sites that pass their own `closeButtonProps` still win — `useProps`
    // merges theme defaults *under* explicit props — so a dialog wanting a more
    // specific name ("Close explain") just says so.

      // The cast is about the type, not the behaviour. `CloseButtonProps`
      // extends `BoxProps`/`StylesApiProps` but not `ElementProps<'button'>`,
      // so `aria-label` is missing from it even though the component is
      // polymorphic over `button` and spreads the prop straight onto the
      // element. `close-button-label.spec.tsx` asserts the rendered result
      // rather than trusting either the cast or the docs.
