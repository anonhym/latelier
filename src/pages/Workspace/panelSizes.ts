 * `collapsedSize` is 4, so `< 1` never fires on a collapse, which left the
 * whole thing resting on a React state flag read inside a callback that
 * `toggleBuilder` can trigger synchronously, before the re-render.
 *
 * Geometry does not have that problem. A drag cannot produce a width below
 * `minSize`, so anything below it came from us — true whenever the handler
