 * This is what #20's roving focus needs to turn "ArrowDown" into "the next
 * visible row": unlike `TableView`/`TreeView` (one roving row per document,
 * a fixed count), a field tree's row count and order change as the user
 * expands/collapses sibling fields, so there's no static index to roll a
 * highlight over — it has to be recomputed from `doc` + `expandedPaths` on
 * every render.
 *
 * Pulled out of `DocFieldTree.tsx` (a components-only file, same reason
 * `docId.ts` lives next to it as its own module) so this pure function gets
 * fast `tests/unit/` coverage without needing a DOM.
