/**
 * X19 #54 — the keyboard-operable half of a click-to-expand table row.
 *
 * IndexesTab and UsersTab both expand a detail row by making the whole
 * `<Table.Tr>` clickable with no `role`/`tabIndex`/`onKeyDown` — unreachable
 * from a keyboard. The fix is a real `<button aria-expanded>` carrying the
 * chevron, per specs/X19-keyboard-operability.md: Mantine ships no
 * expandable-row primitive, and a focusable `<tr>` is the wrong shape when
 * the chevron already is the visual affordance.
 *
 * This button carries no `onClick` of its own. A click bubbles once to the
 * row's own `onClick` (which still toggles on a click anywhere in the row,
 * unchanged), and Enter/Space on the focused button fire that same native
 * click — so mouse and keyboard both end up at the one toggle, and the
 * button itself never unmounts across a toggle, keeping focus in place.
