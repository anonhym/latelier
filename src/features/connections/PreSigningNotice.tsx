 * X09 Phase 3 — the last unsigned release tells macOS users what the next
 * one changes. The signed build has a new app identity, and macOS ties the
 * saved passwords' keychain item to it, so they are not readable after the
 * update: exporting with passwords now is the way to keep them.
 *
 * Shown once per launch until exported or dismissed for good; closing it
 * only defers it. Only with saved Connections, since otherwise there is
 * nothing to keep. Decided once at mount, so creating a Connection mid-session
 * never pops it up. Remove it from the signed release.
