/**
 * The tracer bullet for switching Connections without leaving the
 * Data View. Search-first, not a menu (deliberately no "show search past N
 * connections" threshold — that was prototyped and rejected because it makes
 * the popover's shape change under the user as they add Connections).
 *
 * Status is read straight off `ConnectionSummary['status']` — no parallel
 * status vocabulary. `connections` is the same array `Workspace` already
 * subscribes to via `useConnections()`, so live status updates (connect /
 * fail / disconnect) reach this component for free; it does not own a
 * subscription of its own.
 *
 * The keyboard contract below is the reason the search-first shape
 * won the prototype: find-and-switch has to be one uninterrupted gesture.
 *
 *   ↑ / ↓   move through the filtered list (wraps at both ends)
 *   ↵       connect to the highlighted Connection and make it active
 *   ⌘↵      open the highlighted Connection's management screen
 *   ⌫       on an empty search, disconnect the highlighted Connection
 *   Esc     close, changing nothing
 *
 * Focus never leaves the search field for arrow/Enter navigation — the
 * highlight roves via `aria-activedescendant`, the combobox pattern, so
 * typing and navigating are the same gesture. That is also why the `role="option"`
 * rows themselves are not tab stops (the per-row edit button is a
 * deliberate, narrow exception — see `ConnectionRow`).
 *
 * The handler is bound to the dropdown, never to the document. That placement
 * is what keeps arrows out of every other text-entry surface in the Data View
 * — the query bar, the script editor, a rename field: the Switcher simply
 * never sees those keys. Inside the dropdown the search field is the only
 * element that can hold a caret, and taking its arrows is the point.
 *
 * Two more affordances joined later, both plain click/Tab targets rather than
 * extensions to the arrow-key contract above: "+ Add connection" (pinned
 * above the list, unaffected by search) and a per-row edit button that opens
 * the same Connection form as a modal, prefilled.
 *
 * The remaining ADR 0001 actions — manage, disconnect, delete — joined as
 * the same kind of inline, highlighted-row-only icon buttons rather than the
 * per-row `⋯` menu the ADR originally specified (rejected by the prototype;
 * see the ADR's Prototype findings). Manage and disconnect already had a
 * keyboard path (⌘↵, ⌫); this gives them a pointer one too, and gives delete
 * — which has no keyboard shortcut, deliberately, since it's destructive and
 * asks for confirmation regardless — its only path.
 *
 * `⌘E` — and an "Expand" button in the footer that does the same — covers
 * the case where the popover itself is too small: comparing two similarly-named
 * Connections, reading detail, or managing several in a row. Expanding
 * *closes* the popover rather than stacking on it (ADR 0001: only one list of
 * Connections is ever on screen), so this reuses `close()`, the same as
 * every other action here that leaves the Switcher.

        about the *row* competing with the roving highlight, not about every

        leaves the dropdown today — this adds stops before that exit, which is
        how a keyboard-only user reaches these actions without a mouse. A
        nested interactive element inside `role="option"` is outside what ARIA
        guarantees screen readers expose in the listbox's own browse mode, so
        this is a keyboard-first affordance, not a verified screen-reader one
        — narrowing that gap is follow-up work, not blocking here.

        Order — manage, disconnect, edit, delete — puts the destructive action
        last and furthest from the others, on purpose: the four sit 20px apart
        in a 300px popover, and delete is the one action here a stray click

  /**
   * Recovers focus when a row action button disappears out from under it.
   * The whole cluster is gated on `isHighlighted` (a row's actions render
   * only while it's the highlighted one), so a button holding focus vanishes
   * whenever the highlight moves off its row — and that can happen two ways:
   * the mouse moving over a different row while this one is Tab-focused, or
   * (disconnect specifically) a status event repainting this row to
   * non-live after a click, since disconnect is the one action that doesn't
   * close the popover first. Either way, with nothing else to claim it, focus
   * drops to `<body>` — and since `handleKeyDown` lives on this dropdown,
   * every keyboard path into the still-open popover, Escape included, goes
   * dead until the user clicks out or reopens it.
   *
   * Polling `document.activeElement` after the renders that can cause this
   * — rather than reacting to a native blur/focusout event — covers both
   * triggers with one check and needs no listener wired to whichever button
   * happens to be involved. `document.body` (not merely "focus left this
   * button") is what keeps this from fighting a deliberate Tab-out: Mantine's
   * `Popover` doesn't focus-trap (see the row-actions comment above), so
   * Tab-ing past the last button hands focus to a real next element
   * elsewhere on the page — never to `<body>`. Only an involuntary loss
   * lands there.
