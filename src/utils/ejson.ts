/**
 * Canonical EJSON, rendered for a human to read and edit (UX review §4.1).
 *
 * The drawers used to show `"age": {"$numberInt": "67"}` and a date as
 * `{"$date": {"$numberLong": "1738284528524"}}`, so changing an age meant
 * editing a string inside an object and changing a date meant decoding epoch
 * milliseconds. This unwraps the sentinels a person should not have to read.
 *
 * **It unwraps only what re-parses to the identical BSON.** That is the whole
 * design, and it is why the output is safe to hand back as an *editable*
 * buffer rather than needing a second canonical copy alongside it. bson's own
 * relaxed mode is not safe for this: measured against this repo's bson,
 * `{"$numberLong":"9007199254740993"}` relaxes to `9007199254740992` — the
 * silent precision loss ADR 0004's second rejected option is about, handed to
 * the user as something to copy.
 *
 * So the rules are derived from the round trip, not from readability:
 *
 * | sentinel | rendered as | why |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `$numberInt` | a plain number | int32 re-infers as int32 |
 * | `$numberDouble`, fractional | a plain number | stays a double |
 * | `$numberDouble`, integral or non-finite | unchanged | `2.0` re-infers as int32; `Infinity` is not a JSON number |
 * | `$date` | `{"$date":"<ISO>"}` | exact across the whole JS Date range |
 *
 * Note on that last row: `{"$date":"<ISO>"}` is EJSON's *Relaxed* spelling of
 * a date, not the Canonical one. It is included anyway because the rule here
 * is round-trip exactness rather than canonical form — `$date` is a single-key
 * exact sentinel in both spellings, so it revives to the identical `Date`. No
 * buffer rendered by this function is ever persisted or sent as the stored
 * query text, so ADR 0004's "stored text is always Canonical EJSON" invariant
 * is untouched.
 * | `$numberLong`, `$numberDecimal`, `$oid`, everything else | unchanged | no lossless shorter form |
 *
 * The guarantee is about text this function *emits*. Once a user edits the
 * buffer it is ordinary input again, gated by `isValidEjson` like any other.
 *
 * Renderer-only, and deliberately **not** mirrored into
 * `electron/mongo/ejson.ts`. Nothing crosses the IPC boundary in this form —
 * the wire format is still canonical, and this is a display of it.

 *   below (`String(Infinity)` really is `"Infinity"`) and would be emitted as

 * - `Number.isInteger(n) !== integral` — the guard that actually fires, and

 *   canonicalizes to `"1e+30"`, so the text check below agrees and would wave
 *   it through. Unwrapping it happens to be lossless on today's bson; it stays
 *   wrapped anyway, because the day that spelling changes the failure mode is
 *   a silent type change on a surface that writes documents.
 * - `String(n) === text` — rejects any spelling bson would not produce again.
 *   Unreachable against today's bson: every mis-spelling it could catch, the
 *   integral guard catches first, and deleting this line breaks no test. It
 *   is kept because the two cover *different* hypotheticals — the integral
 *   guard survives bson writing `Double(2)` as `"2"`, this one survives bson
