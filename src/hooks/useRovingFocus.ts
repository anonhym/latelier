  // before `aria-activedescendant` names it); the rest is a convergence
  // loop, one `requestAnimationFrame` at a time: check first whether the row
  // is now fully visible (`isRowFullyVisible`, above); if not, re-scroll and
  // check again next frame. #62's original fix re-scrolled exactly once,
  // two frames out, on the theory that the mount -> layout effect ->
  // `ResizeObserver` chain always settles by then — #119 found that false
  // under CPU load (13/40 loaded e2e runs left the last row off-screen
  // permanently), because a *stale* estimate holds perfectly still until
  // `ResizeObserver` actually fires, so a "did the rect stop moving" or "did
  // scrollTop stop changing" stop condition converges falsely. Checking real
  // geometry instead means it can't declare victory on a stale reading.
  // Harmless for ArrowUp/ArrowDown, which don't hit this (each step moves at
  // most one row, so there's no unmeasured span to accumulate error over) —
  // and with the check-first order, a row already visible on frame 1 costs
  // zero extra `scrollToIndex` calls.

  // fires. `i` was captured when it was still a valid index; by settle time
  // it can be `>= count`, and react-window's `scrollToRow` throws
  // `RangeError` for that. Checked on every frame of the loop, not just
  // once, since the loop can run up to `MAX_SETTLE_FRAMES` times.
