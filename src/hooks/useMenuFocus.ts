/**
 * X19/#55/#68/#69/#87 — dismiss and focus management for a hand-rolled
 * (non-`ContextMenu`-component) context menu: `TableView`'s cell/field
 * menus, `TreeView`'s field menu. Replaces `useKeyboardMenuFocus` and
 * `useMenuDismiss`, which used to split this job in two — see #87 for why
 * that split was the bug.
 *
 * The shared Mantine-backed `ContextMenu` doesn't need this: `Menu`'s own
 * `FocusTrap` grabs focus on open regardless of how it was opened, and its
 * `handleClose` restores focus itself. #87 measured whether `ContextMenu`
 * has the same "outside click steals focus back" defect this hook fixes,
 * against jsdom + `userEvent` (`ContextMenu`, an `outside` button, a click on
 * that button) — it does not: Mantine's outside-click dismiss fires on
 * `pointerdown`, before the click's own focusing step runs, so `handleClose`'s
 * unconditional `.focus(returnFocusTo)` is already done by the time the
 * browser moves focus to the actually-clicked element, and the browser's
 * focus wins. That ordering is also why the unconditional call is *correct*
 * for Escape and item activation, where nothing else is competing for focus.
 * Nothing to fix there; no shared predicate was worth extracting for a
 * defect that doesn't reproduce.
 *
 * ## Two independent defects, one root cause
 *
 * `close` fires on any window click, wherever it lands — a click is a
 * deliberate statement of where the user wants to be, and the old dismiss
 * listener couldn't tell "landed on nothing focusable" from "landed on
 * another control" (#87's first facet). Separately, the old focus hook's
 * cleanup fired on *any* dependency change, including one open being
 * replaced by another (a second right-click, no close in between) — so it
 * restored focus to the *previous* menu's target even though nothing had
 * closed (#87's second facet, filed as a comment on the same issue).
 *
 * Both are fixed by moving the restore out of an effect cleanup and into the
 * effect body, gated on `menu` having actually become `null`: a replacement
 * goes non-null -> non-null, so that branch never runs for it, by
 * construction. And the click listener decides suppression by reading
 * `document.activeElement` *inside* the click handler, which runs after the
 * browser's own focusing steps for that click — so it already knows where
 * (if anywhere) focus landed:
 *
 * | click target | `document.activeElement` after | so |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | a focusable control | that control | suppress the restore |
 * | a plain non-focusable element | `<body>` | restore |
 * | a non-focusable child of a focusable ancestor | the ancestor | suppress |
 *
 * A click on a menu item lands inside the menu (`menuRef.current.contains`),
 * so it is never treated as "outside" and the restore still runs on close.
 * In practice a click never reaches this hook's `window` listener at all:
 * `TableView`'s cell and field menus stop propagation on the menu's own
 * wrapper div (`TableView.tsx`'s `onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}`,
 * not on each item), while `TreeView`'s field menu has each item call
 * `e.stopPropagation()` itself — either way, the item's own `onClick`
 * closes the menu directly (`setContextMenu(null)`), which is exactly why
 * the reset below matters — that close path never runs this hook's
 * `onClick` and so never gets a chance to recompute `suppressRef` itself.
 *
 * `suppressRef` is reset to `false` at the top of the dismiss effect's body,
 * which only runs when `menu` is truthy (open, including a replacement) —
 * the `if (!menu) return` guard above it means a close (`menu` -> `null`)
 * skips the reset entirely, so the value the click handler just set survives
 * into the focus effect's body that runs in the same commit. Without this
 * reset: open a menu, suppress a close with an outside click (leaving
 * `suppressRef` `true`), reopen the menu, then activate an item — that
 * item's direct `setContextMenu(null)` never touches `suppressRef`, so the
 * stale `true` survives and strands focus on the just-activated item
 * instead of restoring it. (An Escape-terminated version of that same
 * sequence is not a counterexample: `onKey` clears `suppressRef` itself
 * before calling `close()`, so it would "work" with or without this reset —
 * see `useMenuFocus.spec.ts`'s Escape test for why that one doesn't prove
 * this line is needed, and `add-to-filter-menu.spec.tsx`'s
 * "a suppressed close does not strand focus after the menu reopens and an
 * item is activated" for the one that does.)
 *
 * `close` must be stable (every call site wraps it in `useCallback` with an
 * empty dependency array — see `useMenuDismiss`'s old docstring for why),
 * and so must `menu`'s *identity* across renders that aren't a fresh open:
 * all three call sites hold it in `useState`, so it doesn't change except on
 * an actual open/close/replace.
 *
 * Unmounting the owning view while its menu is open does not restore focus —
 * there is no closing render for the effect to react to. That's a deliberate
 * read of "restore," not a regression: the widget the focus would return to
 * is going away too, and `.focus()` on an already-detached node is a silent
 * no-op (see `navigator-context-menu-focus.spec.tsx`'s docstring for the same
 * call landing on a since-removed node elsewhere in this codebase).
