/**
 * Owns the clamp-at-render + wrap-around arithmetic shared by every
 * keyboard-navigable list in the app (`ConnectionSwitcher`, `SuggestionPopover`,
 * `CommandPalette`, `ConnectionExpandedTable`). Doesn't own key
 * bindings or DOM wiring: callers differ too much (a subtree `onKeyDown` vs.
 * a manual `window`/anchor `addEventListener`) to unify that too; this hook
 * only owns "what index is highlighted right now."
 *
 * `move` computes from the latest highlight a setter wrote (#126), clamped
 * with the same rules as `index`, not from the raw stored one — this is `ConnectionSwitcher`'s original approach (the one named
 * "the better base" when this hook was extracted), which stays correct
 * even when `count` shrinks out from under a standing highlight for a
 * reason the component never sees
 * (e.g. a Connection deleted elsewhere in the app while its popover is
 * open) — the next arrow press still walks from a row that's actually on
 * screen, not from a stale raw index.
 *
 * `resetKey`: pass a value that changes when the underlying list is
 * conceptually "new" (e.g. a search query) to reset the highlight to `0`
 * without an effect — the same trick a command palette needs when it
 * doesn't own the search input's `onChange` directly. Omit it for a
 * component that resets the highlight itself (an explicit `setIndex(0)`
 * alongside its own query handler).
