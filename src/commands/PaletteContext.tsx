/**
 * Publishes route-derived palette context. Mounted at the App level so every
 * `when` predicate sees the same values. The provider sits outside the
 * `<Routes>` tree, so route params are parsed from the pathname rather than
 * pulled via `useParams` (which would return empty here).
 *
 * Tab-scoped state stays inside Workspace via component-level command
 * registrations rather than being pushed through this context.
 *
 * `connectionId` prefers the URL (`/connections/:id`) over the Data View's
 * Connection, not the other way round: on the deep management screen the
 * route id is the Connection being managed, which can differ from whatever
 * Connection the Data View is on — `connection.edit` and `connection.delete`
 * must act on the one you're looking at, not the one that happens to be open
 * elsewhere. Off that screen (notably the Data View home, where the route
 * carries no id) it falls back to the Focused Tab's Connection
 * — without this, every command gated on `connectionId` silently stops being
 * offered the moment `/workspace` became the app's home screen instead of
 * `/connections/:id`.
