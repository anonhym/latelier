 * Runs the unit / integration / component vitest projects sequentially
 * instead of combined (`vitest run` with vitest.config.ts's `projects`
 * array) — the combined run intermittently hangs at 0% CPU with
 * no worker children, and a killed hang can report exit 0 on an empty log.
 * Run separately, each project always completes quickly.
 *
 * Each project also gets a hard wall-clock timeout so a hang fails loudly
 * (non-zero exit) instead of running forever or being silently killed.

// `npx` is looked up on PATH — a writable directory ahead of the real npm bin
// wins the lookup — and it will happily fetch vitest from the registry when the
// local install is missing. Running the lockfile-pinned file under this Node
// removes both. Resolution goes through `package.json` (the only path vitest's
// `exports` map publishes besides its API entries) and then its own `bin` entry,
// so a bin rename is followed rather than hard-coded. `createRequire` is needed
// because ESM has no `require.resolve`.

// A hang detector, not a performance budget. The hang sits at 0% CPU
// with no worker children and never finishes, so a generous ceiling catches it
// exactly as well as a tight one — while a tight one fails runs where every
// test passed. That is what happened at 5 minutes: the component project
// legitimately takes ~5 min on CI's 2-core runner and was clearing the kill by
// 8 seconds, less than the observed run-to-run variance.
//
// Size this at several times the slowest project's real wall-clock. If the
// component project ever approaches 15 minutes, the answer is to look at why,
// not to raise this again.
